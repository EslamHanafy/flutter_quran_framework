A meal was presented to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم but he refused to eat from it.

He met a Jewish religious scholar and asked him about their religion. He said, “I intend to embrace your religion, so tell me something about it.” The Jew said, “You will not embrace our religion unless you receive your share of Allâh''s Anger.” Zaid said, “I do not run except from Allâh’s Anger, and I will never bear a bit of it if I have the power to avoid it. Can you tell me of some other religion?” He said, “I do not know any other religion except Hanîf (Islâmic Monotheism): Zaid enquired, “What is Hanîf?” He said, “Hanîf is the religion of (the Prophet) Abraham عليه السلام, he was neither a Jew nor a Christian, and he used to worship none but\nAllâh (Alone) — Islâmic Monotheism.” When Zaid heard their statement about (the religion of) Abraham, he left that place, and when he came out, he raised both his hands and said, “O Allâh! I make You my Witness that I am on the religion of Abraham’.\nNarrated Asmâ’ bint Abî Bakr رضي الله عنهما: I saw Zaid ibn ‘Amr ibn Nufail standing with his back against the Ka‘bah and saying, “O people of Quraish! By Allâh, none amongst you is on the religion of Abraham except me.” She added: He (Zaid) used to preserve the lives of little girls; if somebody wanted to kill his daughter he would say to him, “Do not kill her for I will feed her on your behalf.” So he would take her, and when she grew up nicely, he would say to her father, ‘Now if you will (wish), I will give her to you, and if you will (wish), I will feed her on your behalf.” (Sahîh Al-Bukhârî, Vol.5, Hadîth No.169).\n(V. 1:7) Narrated ‘Ubâdah ibn As-Sâmit رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, “Whoever does not recite Sûrat Al-Fâtihah in his prayer, his prayer is invalid.” (Sahîh Al-Bukhârî, Vol.1, Hadîth No.723).\n(V. 1:7) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : Allâh''s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, “When the Imâm says : Ghairil-maghdûbi ‘alaihim walad-dâllîn [i.e. not the way of those who earned Your Anger, nor the way of those who went astray (1:7)], then you must say, Âmîn, for if one’s utterance of Âmîn coincides with that of the angels, then his past sins will be forgiven.” (Sahîh Al-Bukhârî, Vol.6, Hadîth No.2).', 'The Way of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace!, not (the way) of those who earned Your Anger (i.e. those whose intentions are perverted: they know the Truth, yet do not follow it), nor of those who went astray (i.e. those who have lost the (true) knowledge, so they wander in error, and are not guided to the Truth).

He met a Jewish religious scholar and asked him about their religion. He said, “I intend to embrace your religion, so tell me something about it.” The Jew said, “You will not embrace our religion unless you receive your share of Allâh''s Anger.” Zaid said, “I do not run except from Allâh''s Anger, and I will never bear a bit of it if I have the power to avoid it.

The Christian said, “You will not embrace our religion unless you get a share of Allâh''s Curse.” Zaid replied, “I do not run except from Allâh''s Curse, and I will never bear any of Allâh’s Curse and His Anger if I have the power to avoid them.

Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man’s head, smashing it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man, his head returned to its normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allâh! Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Proceed!’ So we proceeded and came to a man lying in a prone position, and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man’s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck), and similarly tear his nose from front to back, and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other (second) side of the man’s face and did just as he had done with the first side. He hardly completed that (second) side when the first side returned to its normal state.

I asked them, ‘Who are these?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’ And so we proceeded and came across a river.” I think he said, “— red like blood.” The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, “And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold, while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again.

Beside him there was a fire, and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, ‘Who is this (man)?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’ So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colours. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man, and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, ‘Who is this?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’ So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, ‘Ascend up’ and I ascended up.” The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, “So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks, and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the most handsome person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared, and they became in the best shape.” The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, further added, “My two companions (angels) said to me: ‘This place is the ‘Adn Paradise, and that is your place.’ I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me: ‘That (palace) is your place’ I said to them: ‘May Allâh bless you both! Let me enter it.’ They replied, ‘As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day).’ I said to them, ‘I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?’ They replied, ‘We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon whose head was being smashed with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Qur’ân, and then neither recites it, nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came upon, whose sides of mouth, nostrils, and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells lies that are spread all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers-fornicators and the adulteresses-fornicatresses, and the man whom you saw swimming in the river, and was given a stone to swallow, is the eater of Ribâ (usury), and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going around it, is Mâlik; the gatekeeper of Hell, and the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Ibrâhîm (Abraham), and the children around him are those who die on Al-Fitrah (the Islâmic Faith of Monotheism).’ \"The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم “O Allâh''s Messenger! What about the children of Al-Mushrikûn?*” The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, “And also the children of Al-Mushrikûn.” The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, “My two companions added, ‘The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was evil, but Allâh forgave them.’” (Sahîh Al-Bukhârî, Vol. 9, Hadîth No. 171).\n* Al-Mushrikûn: polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh and in His Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم.', 'And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم)[1] but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums.

Do not let him die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.” So while he was in his hermitage, a lady came and sought to seduce him, but he refused. So she went to a shepherd and presented herself to him te commit illegal sexual intercourse with her, and then later she gave birth to a child and claimed that it belonged to Juraij. The people, therefore, came to him and dismantled his hermitage and expelled him out of it and abused him. Juraij performed ablution and offered prayer, and then came to the child and said: “O child! Who is your father?” The child replied, “The shepherd” (after hearing this) the people said, “We shall rebuild your hermitage of gold,” but he said: “No, of nothing but mud.” (The third was the hero of the following story): A lady from Banî Israel was nursing her child at her breast when a handsome rider passed by her. She said, “O Allâh! Make my child like him.” On that the child left her breast and, facing the rider, said: \"O Allâh! Do not make me like him.” The child then started to suck her breast again.

(357, '64', '3', '[1] (V.3:64) Narrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما: Abu Sufyân narrated to me personally, saying, “I set out during the truce that had been concluded between me and Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, While I was in Shâm, a letter sent by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم was brought to Heraclius. Dihya Al-Kalbi had brought and given it to the governor of Busra, and the latter forwarded it to Heraclius. Heraclius said, ‘Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a Prophet?’ The people replied, ‘Yes,’ so, along with some other Quraishi men, I was called and we entered upon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, ‘Who amongst you is the nearest retative to the man who claims to be a Prophet?’ I (Abu Sufyân) replied: ‘I am the nearest relative to him from amongst the group.’ So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him). ‘Tell them (i.e. Abu Sufyân’s companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyân) regarding that man who claims to be a Prophet. So, if he tells me a lie, they should contradict him (instantly). By Allâh, had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a liar, I would have told lies. Heraclius then said to his translator, ‘Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet''s) family status amongst you?’ I said, ‘He belongs to a noble family amongst us.’ Heraclius said, ‘Was any of his ancestors a king?’ I said, ‘No’. He said, ‘Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?’ I said, ‘No’. He said, ‘Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?’ I said, ‘It is the poor who follow him.’ He said, ‘Is the number of his followers increasing or decreasing?’ I said, ‘They are increasing.’ He said, ‘Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islâm) after embracing it, being displeased with it?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Did you fight with him?’ I replied, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘How was your fighting with him?’ I said, ‘The fighting between us was undecided and victory was shared by him and us in turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties upon him.’ He said, ‘Did he ever betray?’ I said, ‘No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not know what he will do in it.’ ” Abu Sufyân added, “By Allâh, I was not able to insert in my speech a word (against him) except that. Heraclius said, ‘Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claim the same (i.e. to be Allâh’s Prophet) before him?’ I said, ‘No’. Then Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyân), ‘l asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family amongst you. Verily, all Messengers come from the noblest family among their people. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought that had one of his forefathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) was seeking to rule the kingdom of his forefathers. Then I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, and you said that they were only poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the Messengers. Then I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about others, could never tell a lie about Allâh. Then I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islâm) after embracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is faith when its delight enters the heart and mixes with it completely. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You claimed that they were increasing, that is the way of true faith till it is complete. Then I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with him and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in turns; he inflicted casualties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon him. Such is the case with the Messengers, they are put to trials and the final victory is for them. Then I asked you whether he has ever betrayed anyone; you claimed that he had never betrayed. Indeed, Messengers never betray. Then I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that. Thereupon I thought if somebody had said that statement before him, then I would have said that he was but a man copying some sayings said before him.’ Abu Sufyân said, “Heraclius then asked me, ‘What does he order you to do?’ I said, ‘He orders us (to offer) prayers and (to pay) Zakât, and to keep good relationship with the kith and kin, and to be chaste.’ Then Heraclius said, ‘If whatever you have said is true, then he is really a Prophet. I knew that he (i.e. the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) was going to appear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were certain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; and his kingdom will expand (surely) to what is under my feet.’ Then Heraclius asked for the letter of Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and read it, wherein was written:\nIn the Name of Allâh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n(This letter is) from Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh, to Heraclius, the sovereign of Byzantine\nPeace be upon him who follows the Right Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islâm. Embrace Islâm and you will be saved (from Allâh''s punishment); embrace Islâm, and Allâh will give you a double reward, but if you reject this, you will be responsible for the sins of all the people of your kingdom: (Allâh''s Statement):\n“O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allâh (Alone) ... bear witness that we are Muslims.” (3:64).\n“When he finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and there was a great hue and cry, and we were ordered to go out.” Abu Sufyân added, “While coming out, I said to my companions, ‘The matter of Ibn Abu Kabshah* (i.e. Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) has become so prominent that even the king of Banu Al-Asfar (i.e. the Romans) is afraid of him.’ So I continued to believe that Allâh''s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم would be victorious, till Allâh made me embrace Islâm.” Az-Zuhri said, “Heraclius then invited all the chiefs of the Byzantine and had them assembled in his house and said, ‘O group of Byzantine! Do you wish to have a permanent success and guidance and that your kingdom should remain with you?’ (Immediately after hearing that), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they found them closed. Heraclius then said, ‘Bring them back to me.’ So he called them and said, ‘I just wanted to test the strength of your adherence to your religion. Now I have observed of you that which I like.’ Then the people fell in prostration before him and became pleased with him.” (Sahîh Al-Bukhârî, Vol.6, Hadîth No.75).\n* Abu Kabshah was not the father of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم but it was a mockery done by Abu Sufyân out of hostility against the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم.', 'Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): “O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)!

Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?” The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “Yes; do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun at midday when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?” They replied, “No.” He said, “Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a fullmoon night when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?” They replied, “No.” The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, “(Similarly) you will have no difficulty in seeing Allâh (عز و جل) on the Day of Resurrection, as you have no difficulty in seeing either of them.” On the Day of Resurrection, a call-maker will announce, “Let every nation follow that which they used to worship.” Then none of those who used to worship anything other than Allâh like idols and other deities, but will fall in Hell (Fire), till there will remain none but those who used to worship Allâh, both those who were obedient (i.e. good) and those who were disobedient (i.e. bad) and the remaining party of the people of the Scripture. Then the Jews will be called upon and it will be said to them, “Who did you use to worship?” They will say, “We used to worship ‘Uzair (Ezra), the son of Allâh.” It will be said to them, “You are liars, for Allâh has never taken anyone as a wife or a son. What do you want now?” They will say, “O our Lord! We are thirsty, so give us something to drink.” They will be directed and addressed thus, “Will you drink” whereupon they will be gathered unto Hell (Fire) which will look like a mirage whose different sides will be destroying each other. Then they will fall into the Fire. Afterwards the Christians will be called upon and it will be said to them, “Who did you use to worship?” They will say, “We used to worship ‘Îsâ (Jesus), the son of Allâh.” It will be said to them, “You are liars, for Allâh has never taken anyone as a wife or a son.” Then it will be said to them, “What do you want now?” They will say what the former people have said (and will be thrown in the Hellfire like the Jews). Then, when there remain (in the gathering) none but those who used to worship Allâh [Alone; the real Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists)], whether they were obedient or disobedient. Then Allâh, [the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists)], will come to them in a shape nearest to the picture they had in their minds about Him. It will be said, “What are you waiting for? Every nation has followed what it used to worship.” They will reply, “We left the people in the world when we were in great need of them and we did not take them as friends. Now we are waiting for our Lord Whom we used to worship.” Allâh will say, “I am your Lord.” They will say twice or thrice, “We do not worship anything besides Allâh.” (Sahîh Al-Bukhârî, Vol. 6, Hadîth No. 105).\nB) See the footnote of (V.68:42)', 'Surely!

And it was His Word: “Be!” — and he was [i.e. ‘Îsâ (Jesus) was created like Adam].\nb) But when one of the two is Allâh and the second is neither a person nor a thing, then it is not a created thing but is a quality of Allâh e.g. Allâh’s Knowledge (‘Ilm-ullah); Allâh’s Life (Hayât-ullâh); Allâh''s Statement (Kalâm-ullâh); Allâh’s Self (Dhat-ullâh).\n[2] (V.4:171) Narrated ‘Ubadah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, “If anyone testifies that Lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh Alone) Who has no partners, and that Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is His slave and His Messenger, and that Jesus عليه السلام is Allâh''s slave and His Messenger and His Word (\"Be!” — and he was) which He bestowed on Mary and a spirit (Rûh) created by Him, and that Paradise is the truth, and Hell is the truth — Allâh will admit him into Paradise with the deeds which he had done even if those deeds were few.” (Junadah, the subnarrator said, “‘Ubâdah added: ‘Such a person can enter Paradise through any of its eight gates he likes’.\") (Sahîh Al-Bukhârî, Vol. 4, Hadîth No. 644).', 'O people of the Scripture (Christians)!

The angel asked (him), ‘What kind of property do you like best?’ He replied ‘Cows.’ The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, ‘May Allâh bless you in it.’ The angel went to the blind man and asked, ‘What thing do you like best?’ He said, ‘(I like) that Allâh may restore my eyesight to me so that I may see the people.’ The angel touched his eyes and Allâh gave him back his eyesight. The angel asked him, ‘What kind of property do you like best?’ He replied, ‘Sheep.’ The angel gave him a pregnant sheep. Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of sheep filling a valley. Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper, went to the leper and said, ‘I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Allâh and then you. In the Name of Him Who has given you such nice colour and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give me a camel so that I may reach my destination.’ The man replied, ‘I have many obligations (so I cannot give you).’ The angel said, ‘I think I know you. Were you not a leper to whom the people had a strong aversion? Weren''t you a poor man, and then Allâh gave you (all this property).’ He replied, ‘(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance from my forefathers.’ The angel said, ‘If you are telling a lie then let Allâh make you as you were before.’ Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, ‘If you are telling a lie, then let Allâh make you as you were before.’ The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to the blind man and said, ‘I am a poor man and a traveller, whose means of livelihood have been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Allâh, and after Him, you yourself, I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eyesight to give me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey.’ The man said, ‘No doubt, I was blind and Allâh gave me back my eyesight; I was poor and Allâh made me rich; so take anything you wish from my property. By Allâh, I will not stop you for taking anything (you need) of my property which you may take for Allâh''s sake.’ The angel replied, ‘Keep your property with you.

The second man required witnesses.\nThe former replied, ‘Allah is Sufficient as a witness.’ The second said, ‘| want a surety.’ The\nformer replied, ‘Allah is Sufficient as a Surety.’ The second said, ‘You are right’ and lent him\nthe money for a certain period. The debtor went across the sea. When he finished his job,\nhe searched for a conveyance so that he might reach in time for the repayment of the debt,\nbut he could not find any. So, he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it, inserted in it\nOne thousand dinars and a letter to the lender and then closed (i.e. sealed) the hole tightly.\nHe took the piece of wood to the sea and said. ‘O Allâh! You know well that | took a loan of\none thousand dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety from me but ! told him that\nAllah''s Guarantee was sufficient and he accepted Your Guarantee. He then asked for a\nwitness and | told him that Allah was sufficient as a Witness, and he accepted You as a\nWitness. No doubt, | have tried hard to find a conveyance so that | could pay his money\nback but could not find, so ! hand over this money to You.’ Saying that, he threw the piece\nof wood into the sea till it went out far into it, and then he went away. Meanwhile he started\nsearching for a conveyance in order to reach the creditor''s country. One day the lender\ncame out of his house to see whether a ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a\nsudden he saw the piece of wood (in which his money had been deposited). He took it\nhome to use for fire. When he sawed it, he found his money and the letter inside it. Shortly\nafter that, the debtor came bringing one thousand dinars to him and said, ‘By Allah, | had\nbeen trying hard to get a boat so that I could bring you your money, but failed to get one\nbefore the one | have come by.’ The lender asked, ‘Have you sent something to me?’ The\ndebtor replied, ‘! have told you | could not get a boat other than the one | have come by.’\nThe lender said, ‘Allah has delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of\nwood. So, you may keep your one thousand dinars and depart guided on the Right Path.''”\n(Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.3, Hadith No 488B).', '[67]. And he said: “O my sons!

The Story of the building of the Ka‘bah at Makkah:\nNarrated Ibn ‘Abbas رضى الله عنه): [On the authority of the Prophetصلى الله عليه وسلم  (See Fath\nAl-Bari, Vol. 7, Page 210)]. The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Isma''il (Ishmael).\nShe used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah.* Ibrahim (Abraham) brought\nher and her son Isma‘il (Ishmael) while she used to nurse him at her breast, near the\nKa''bah under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During\nthose days there was nobody in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he made them sit\nover there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small\nwater-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Isma‘il’s (Ishmael) mother\nfollowed him saying, \"O Ibrahim (Abraham)! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley\nwhere there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?”\nShe repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him,\n“Has Allah ordered you to do so?” He said, “Yes.” She said, “Then He will not neglect us,”\nand returned while Ibrahim (Abraham) proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniyyah\nwhere they could not see him, he faced the Ka‘bah, and raising both hands invoked Allah\nsaying the following supplication:\n‘O our Lord! | have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your\nSacred House (the Ka‘bah in Makkah); in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As-Salat\n(iqamat-as-Salat). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah)\nprovide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.’ (V.14:37)\nIsma‘il’s (Ishmael) mother went on suckling Isma‘il (Ishmael) and drinking from the water\n(she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and\nher child also became thirsty. She started looking at him i.e. Isma‘il (Ishmaei)] tossing in\nagony; she left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of\nAs-Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at\nthe valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then\nshe descended from As-Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and\nran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached\nAl-Marwah mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but\nshe could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between As-Safa and Al-Marwah)\nseven times.” The Prophet  صلى الله عليه وسلم  said, “This is the source of the tradition of the Say\n(the going) of people between them (i.e. As-Safa and Al-Marwah). When she reached\nAl-Marwah (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and\nlistened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, ‘O (whoever you may be)! You\nhave made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?’ And behold! She saw\nan angei at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water\nflowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her\nhands in this way and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water\nwas flowing out after she had scooped some of it.” The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, “May\nAllâh bestow mercy on Isma''il’s (Ishmael) mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without\ntrying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam\nwould have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.” The Prophet  صلى الله عليه وسلم\nfurther added, “Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, ‘Don’t\nbe afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and\nhis father, and Allah never neglects His people.’ The House (i.e. Ka‘bah) at that time was on\na high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left.\nShe lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum\npassed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way\nof Kada’. They landed in the lower part of Makkah where they saw a bird that had the habit\nof flying around water and not leaving it. They said, ‘This bird must be flying around water,\nthough we know that there is no water in this valley.’ They sent one or two messengers who\ndiscovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they ail came\n(towards the water).” The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, “Isma‘il''s (Ishmael) mother was\nsitting near the water. They asked her, ‘Do you allow us to stay with you?’ She replied, ‘Yes,\nbut you will have no right to possess the water.’ They agreed to that.” The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم further said, “Isma''il’s (Ishmael) mother was pleased with the whole situation as she\nused to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they\nsent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became\npermanent residents there. The child [i.e. Isma‘i! (Ishmael)] grew up and learnt Arabic from\nthem and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he\nreached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After\nIsma‘il’s (Ishmael) mother had died, Ibrahim (Abraham) came after Isma‘il’s (Ishmael)\nmarriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Isma’‘il\n \n(Ishmael) there. When he asked Isma''il’s (ishmael) wife about him, she replied, ‘He has\ngone in search of our livelihood.’ Then he asked her about their way of living and their\ncondition, and she replied, ‘We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and\ndestitution,’ complaining to him. He said, ‘When your husband returns, convey my salutation\nto him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).’ When Isma’‘il\n(Ishmael) came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, ‘Has\nanyone visited you?’ She replied, ‘Yes, an old man of such and such description came and\nasked me about you and | informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and ! told\nhim that we were living in a hardship and poverty.’ On that Isma''il (Ishmael) said, ‘Did he\nadvise you anything?’ She replied, ‘Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to\ntell you to change the threshold of your gate.’ Isma’il (Ishmael) said, ‘It was my father, and\nhe has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.’ So, isma‘il (Ishmael) divorced\nher and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Ibrahim (Abraham)\nstayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but\ndid not find Isma‘i! (Ishmael). So he came to Isma‘il’s (Ishmael) wife and asked her about\nIsma‘il (Ishmael). She said, ‘He has gone in search of our livelihood.’ Ibrahim (Abraham)\nasked her, ‘How are you getting on?’ asking her about their sustenance and living. She\nreplied, ‘We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).’ Then she\nthanked Allah عز وجل . Ibrahim (Abraham) said, ‘What kind of food do you eat?’ She said,\n‘Meat.’ He said, ‘What do you drink?’ She said, ‘Water.’ He said, ‘O Allah! Bless their meat\nand water.’” The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم  added, “At that time they did not have grain, and if\nthey had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to biess it.” The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم\nadded, “If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition\nwill be badly affected, untess he lives in Makkah.” The Prophet  صلى الله عليه وسلمadded, “Then\nIbrahim (Abraham) said to Ismai‘il’s (ishmael) wife, ‘When your husband comes, give my\nregards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.’ When Isma’ii\n(Ishmael) came back, he asked his wife, ‘Did anyone call on you?’ She replied, ‘Yes, a\ngood-looking old man came to me,’ so she praised him and added. ‘He asked about you,\nand | informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and | told him that we were in a good\ncondition.’ Isma‘il (Ishmael) asked her, ‘Did he give you any piece of advice?’ She said,\n‘Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the\nthreshold of your gate.’ On that Isma''il (Ishmael) said, ‘It was my father, and you are the\nthreshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me.’ Then Ibrahim (Abraham)\nstayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards.\nHe saw Ismail (Ishmael) under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw\nIbrahim (Abraham), he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father\ndoes with his son or a son does with his father). Ibrahim (Abraham) said, ‘O Isma’il\n(Ishmael)! Allah has given me an order.’ Isma’‘il (Ishmael) said, ‘Do what your Lord has\nordered you to do.’ {brahim (Abraham) asked, ‘Will you help me?’ Isma‘il (Ishmael) said, ‘|\nwill help you.’ Ibrahim (Abraham) said, ‘Allah has ordered me to build a house here,’\npointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.” ” The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added,\n“Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka‘bah). Isma’il (Ishmael) brought\nthe stones and Ibrahim (Abraham) was building; and when the wails became high, Isma‘il\n(Ishmael) brought this stone and put it for brahim (Abraham) who stood over it and carried\non building, while Isma‘il (Ishmael) was handing him the stones, and both of them were\nsaying, ‘O our Lord!

(2200, '60', '18', '[1].(V.18:60) The Story of Mûsâ (Moses) and Al-Khidr عليهما السلام, Narrated Sa''îd ibn Jubair: |\nSaid to Ibn ‘Abbâs, “Nauf Al-Bikali claims that Mûsâ (Moses), the companion of Al-Khidr was\nnot the Mûsâ (Moses) of the Children of Israel.” Ibn ‘Abbâs said, “The enemy of Allâh (Nauf)\ntold a lie.” Narrated ‘Ubayy ibn Ka’b that he heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying,\n“Mûsâ (Moses) got up to deliver a speech before the Children of Israel and he was asked,\n‘Who is the most learned person among the people?’ Mûsâ (Moses) replied, ‘I (am the most\nlearned).’ Allâh admonished him for he did not ascribe knowledge to Allâh Alone. So Allâh\nrevealed to him: ‘At the junction of the two seas there is a slave of Ours who is more\nlearned than you.’ Mûsâ (Moses) asked, ‘O my Lord, how can | meet him?’ Allâh said, ‘Take\na fish and put it in a basket and then proceed (set out and where you lose the fish, you will\nfind him).’ So Mûsâ (Moses) (took a fish and put it in a basket and) set out, along with his\nboy-servant Yûsha ibn Nûn, till they reached a rock (on which) they both lay their heads\nand slept. The fish moved vigorously in the basket and got out of it and fell into the sea and\nthere it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel. (V.18:61) Allâh stopped the\ncurrent of water on both sides of the way created by the fish, and so that way was like a\ntunnel. When Mûsâ (Moses) got up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, and so\nthey carried on their journey during the rest of the day and the whole night. The next\nmorning Mûsâ (Moses) asked his boy-servant ‘Bring us our morning meal: truly, we have\nsuffered much fatigue in this, our journey.’ (V.18:62)\nMûsâ (Moses) did not get tired till he had passed the place which Allâh had ordered him to\nseek after. His boy-servant then said to him, ‘Do you remember when we betook ourselves\nto the rock? | indeed forgot the fish; none but Satan made me forget to remember it. It took\nits course into the sea in a strange way.’ (V.18:63)\nThere was a tunnel for the fish and for Mûsâ (Moses) and his boy-servant there was\nastonishment. Mûsâ (Moses) said, ‘That is what we have been seeking’. So they went back\nretracing their footsteps. (V.18:64) They both returned, retracing their steps till they reached\nthe rock. Behold! There they found a man covered with a garment. Musa (Moses) greeted\nhim. Al-Khidr said astonishingly, ‘Is there such a greeting in your land?’ Mûsa (Moses) said,\n‘I am Musa (Moses).’ He said, ‘Are you the Mûsâ (Moses) of the Children of \\srael?’ Mûsâ\n(Moses) said, ‘Yes’; and added, ‘I have come to you so that you may teach me something of\nthat knowledge which you have been taught’.\nAl-Khidr said, ‘You will not be able to have patience with me.’ (V.18:67)\n‘O Mûsâ (Moses)! | have some of Allâh''s Knowledge which He has bestowed upon me but\nyou do not know it; and you too, have some of Allâh''s Knowledge which He has bestowed\nupon you, but | do not know it.” Mûsâ (Moses) said, ‘If Allâh wills, you will find me patient,\nand | will not disobey you in aught.’ (V.18:69).\nAl-Khidr said to him. ‘Then, if you follow me, ask me not about anything till | myself mention\nit to you.’ (V.18:70). After that both of them proceeded along the sea coast, till ship passed\nby and they requested the crew to let them go on board. The crew recognized Al-Khidr and\nallowed them to get on board free of charge. When they got on board, suddenly Mûsâ\n(Moses) saw that Al-Khidr had pulled out one of the planks of the ship with an adze. Mûsâ\n(Moses) said to him, ‘These people gave us a free lift, yet you have scuttled their ship so as\nto drown its people! Verily, you have committed a thing ‘imra’ (a Munkar — evil, bad,\ndreadful thing).’ (V.18:71)\nAl-Khidr said, ‘Did | not tell you, that you would not be able to have patience with me?’\n(V.18:72)\nMûsâ (Moses) said, ‘Call me not to account for what | forgot and be not hard upon me for\nmy affair (with you.)’ (V.18:73).”\n\nAllâh''s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, “The first excuse given by Mûsâ (Moses), was that\nhe had forgotten. Then a sparrow came and sat over the edge of the ship and dipped its\nbeak once in the sea. Al-Khidr said to Mûsâ (Moses), ‘My knowledge and your knowledge,\ncompared to Allâh''s Knowledge is like what this sparrow has taken out of the sea.’ Then\nthey both got out of the ship, and while they were walking on the sea shore, Al-Khidr saw a\nboy playing with other boys. Al-Khidr got hold of the head of that boy and pulled it out with\nhis hands and killed him. Mûsâ (Moses) said, ‘Have you killed an innocent person who had\nkilled none! Verily, you have committed a thing ‘Nukra’ (a great Munkar - prohibited, evil,\ndreadful thing)!’ (V.18:74) He said, ‘Did | not tell you that you would not be able to have\npatience with me?’ (V.18:75) (The subnarrator said, ‘The second blame was stronger than\nthe first one). Mûsâ (Moses) said, ‘If | ask you anything after this, keep me not in your\ncompany; you have received an excuse from me.’ (V.18:76)\nThen they both proceeded until they came to the people of a town. They asked them for\nfood but they refused to entertain them. (Then) they found there a wall on the point of falling\ndown. (V.18:77) (Al-Khidr) set it up straight with his own hands. Mûsâ (Moses) said, ‘We\ncame to these people, but they neither fed us nor received us as guests. If you had wished,\nyou could surely have exacted some recompense for it.’ (Al-Khidr) said, ‘This is the parting\nbetween me and you, (please read V. 18:79, 80-82) that is the interpretation of those\n(things) over which you could not hold patience.’ (V.18:78-82).”\nAllâh''s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, “We wished Mûsâ (Moses) had more patience so\nthat Allâh might have described to us more about their story.” (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 6,\nHadith No. 249).', '60.

A golden tray full of wisdom and belief was brought to me and\nmy body was cut open from the throat to the lower part of the abdomen and then my\nabdomen was washed with Zamzam water and (my heart was) filled with wisdom and belief.\nAl-Burâq, a white animal smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me\nand | set out with Jibrîl (Gabriel). When | reached the nearest heaven, Jibrîl said to the\ngate-keeper of the heaven, ‘Open the gate.’ The gate-keeper asked, ‘Who is it?’ He said,\n‘Jibrîl.’ The gate-keeper, said ‘Who is accompanying you?’ Jibrîl said, ‘Muhammad صلي الله عليه وسلم: The gate-keeper said, ‘Has he been called?’ Jibrîl said, ‘Yes’. Then it was said, ‘He\nis welcome. What a wonderful visit his is!’ Then | met Adam and greeted him and he said,\n“You are welcome O son and a Prophet.’ Then we ascended to the second heaven. It was\nasked, ‘Who is it?’ Jibrîl said, ‘Jibrîl.'' It was said, ''Who is with you? He said, ‘Muhammadصلي الله عليه وسلم’ it was asked,‘Has he been sent for?’ He said, ‘Yes.’It was said, ‘He is\nwelcome.

There | met and greeted Mûsâ\n(Moses) who said, ‘You are welcome, O brother and a Prophet.’ When | proceeded on, he\nstarted weeping and on being asked why he was weeping, he said, ‘O Lord! followers of this\nyouth who was sent after me will enter Paradise in greater number than my followers.’ Then\nwe ascended to the seventh heaven and again the same questions and answers were\nexchanged as in the previous heavens. There | met and greeted Abraham who said, ‘You\nare welcome, O son and a Prophet.’ Then | was shown Al/-Bait Al-Ma‘midr (i.e. Allah''s\nHouse). | asked Jibrîl about it and he said, ‘This is A/-Bait Al-Ma''mûr where 70,000 angels\nperform prayers daily; and when they leave they never return to it (but always a fresh batch\ncomes into it daily).'' Then | was shown Sidrat-ul Muntaha (i.e. the lote-tree of the utmost\nboundary over the seventh heaven) and | saw its Nabiq fruits which resembled the clay jugs\nof Hajar (a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants, and four rivers\noriginated at its root: two of them were apparent and two were hidden. | asked Jibrîl about\nthose rivers and he said, ‘The two hidden rivers are in Paradise and the apparent ones are\nthe Nile and the Euphrates.’ Then fifty prayers were enjoined on me. | descended till | met\nMûsâ who asked me, ‘What have you done?’ | said, ‘Fifty prayers have been enjoined on\nme.’ He said, ‘I know the people better than you, because | had the hardest experience to\nbring Banî Israel to obedience.

Such a one will try to prostrate himself\n(on the Day of Judgement) but his back (bones) will become a single (vertebra) bone (so he\nwill not be able to prostrate). (Sahîh Al-Bukhdârî, Vol.6, Hadîth No.441).\nb) See the footnote of (V.3:73) صفات الله,\nc) Narrated Abû Sa‘îd Al-Khudrî رضي الله عنه: We said, “O Allâh’s Messenger! Shall we see\nour Lord on the Day of Resurrection?” He said, “Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun\nand the moon when the sky is clear?” We said, “No.” He said, “So you will have no difficulty\nin seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon (in\na clear sky).” The Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم then said, “Somebody will then announce, ‘Let\nevery nation follow what they used to worship.’ So the people of the Cross will go with their\nCross, and the idolaters (will go) with their idols, and the worshippers of every god (false\ndeities) (will go) with their god: till there remain those who used to worship Allâh, from. \nout whomever they will recognise and return. And then Allâh will say, ‘Go and take out (of\nHell) anyone in whose heart you find Faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant),\nand so they will take out all those whom they will recognise.” Abû Sa‘id said: “If you do not\nbelieve me then read the Holy Verse: ‘Surely Allâh wrongs not even of the weight of an\natom (or a small ant) but if there is any good (done), He doubles it.’ (V.4:40).”\nThe Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم  added: “Then the Prophets and angels and the believers will\nintercede, and (last of all) the Almighty (Allâh) will say, ‘Now remains My Intercession. He\nwill then hold a handful of the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies\nhave been bumt, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the\nWater of Life. They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the torrent grows. You have\nnoticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how the side facing the sun is\nusually green while the side facing the shade is white. Those people will come out (of the\nRiver of Life) like pearls, and they will have (golden) necklaces, and then they will enter\nParadise whereupon the people of Paradise will say, ‘These are the people emancipated by\nthe Gracious. He has admitted them into Paradise without (them) having done any good deed\nand without sending forth any good (for themselves).’ Then it will be said to them, ‘For you is\nwhat you have seen and its equivalent as well.’” (Sahîh AL-Bukhâri, Vol. 9, Hadîth No. 532B).\nrighteous pious ones and the mischievous ones, and some of the people of the Scripture\n(Jews and Christians). Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a mirage. Then it will\nbe said to the Jews, ‘What did you use to worship?’ They will reply, ‘We used to worship\n‘Uzair (Ezra), the son of Allâh.’ It will be said to them, ‘You are liars, for Allâh has neither a\nwife nor a son. What do you want (now)?’ They will reply, ‘We want You to provide us with\nwater.’ Then it will be said to them ‘Drink’, and they will fall down in Hell (instead). Then it\nwill be said to the Christians, ‘What did you use to worship?’ They will reply, ‘We used to\nworship Messiah, the son of Allâh.’ It will be said, ‘You are liars, for Allâh has neither a wife\nnor a son. What do you want (now)?’ They will say, ‘We want You to provide us with water.’\nIt will be said to them, ‘Drink,’ and they will fall down in Hell (instead): till there remain only\nthose who used to worship Allâh (Alone), from the righteous pious ones and the\nmischievous evil ones, it will be said to them, ‘What keeps you here when all the people\nhave gone?’ They will say, ‘We left them (in the world) when we were in greater need of\nthem than we are today; we heard the call of one proclaiming — Let every nation follow\nwhat they used to worship, - and now we are waiting for our Lord.’ Then the Almighty will\ncome to them in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, ‘I\nam your Lord,’ and they will say, ‘You are our Lord.’ And none will speak to Him then but the\nProphets. And then it will be said to them, ‘Do you know any sign by which you can\nrecognise Him?’ They will say, ‘The Shin, and so Allâh will then uncover His Shin\nwhereupon every believer will prostrate himself before Him and there will remain those who\nused to prostrate themselves before Him just for showing off and for gaining good\nreputation. Such a one will try to prostrate himself but his back (bones) will become a single\n(vertebra) bone [like one piece of wood and he will not be able to prostrate]. Then the bridge\nwill be brought and laid across Hell.” We (the Companions of the Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم)\nsaid, “O Allâh’s Messenger! What is the bridge?” He said, “It is a slippery (bridge) on which\nthere are clamps and (hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the\nother and has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in Najd and is called\nAs-Sa‘dân. Some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye,\nsome others as quick as lightning, or a strong wind, or fast horses or she-camels. So some\nwill be safe without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some scratches and some\nwill fall down into Hell (Fire). The last person will cross as if being dragged (over the\nbridge).” The Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم said, “In claiming from me a right that has been clearly\nproved to be yours, You (Muslims) cannot be more pressing than the believers in\ninterceding with Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves\nsafe. They will say, ‘O Allâh!

They will go to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to\ntheir feet, and some up to the middle of their legs. So, they will take out those whom they\nwill recognise and then they will return.

(5913, '4', '85', '[1](V.85:4) The Story of the Boy and the King.\nNarrated Shu‘aib رضي الله عنه: Allah''s Messenger صلي الله عليه وسلمsaid: “Among the people\nbefore you, there was a king and he had a sorcerer. When the sorcerer became old, he said\nto the king: ‘| have now become an old man, get me a boy so that | may teach him sorcery.’\nSo the king sent him a boy to teach him sorcery. Whenever the boy proceeded to the\nsorcerer, he sat with a monk who was on the way and listened to his talks and used to\nadmire them (those talks). So when he went to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and sat\nthere with him. And on visiting the sorcerer, the latter thrashed him. So the boy complained\nabout that to the monk. The monk said to him: Whenever you are afraid of the sorcerer, say\nto him: ‘My peopie kept me busy’; and whenever you are afraid of your people, say to them:\n‘The sorcerer kept me busy.’ So the boy carried on like that (for a period).\n“There came (on the main road) a huge creature (animal), and the people were unable to\npass by. The boy said: ‘Today | will know whether the sorcerer is better or the monk’. So he\ntook a stone and said: ‘O Allâh! If the deeds and actions of the monk are liked by You better\nthan those of the sorcerer, then kill this creature so that the people can cross (the road).’\nThen he hit (it) with the stone, and it was killed and the people passed (the road). The boy\ncame to the monk and informed him about it. The monk said to him: ‘O my son! Today you\nare better than |; you have achieved what | see! And you will be put to trial. And in case you\nare put to trial, do not inform (them) about me.’ The boy used to treat the people suffering\nfrom born-blindness, leprosy, leucoderma, and other diseases. A blind courtier of the king\nheard about the boy. He came and brought a number of gifts for the boy and said: ‘All these\ngifts are for you on condition that you cure me’.The boy said: ‘I do not cure anybody; it is\nonly Allâh (Alone) Who cures (people). So if you believe in Allâh, and invoke Allâh, He will\ncure you’. He then believed in Allâh, and Allah cured him. Later the courtier came to the\nking, and sat at the place where he used to sit before. The king asked him: ‘Who has given\nyou your sight back ?’ The courtier replied:‘My Lord (Allâh)!’ The king said: ‘Have you got\nanother lord than I?’ The courtier said: ‘My Lord and your Lord is Allâh!’ The king got hold of\nhim and kept on tormenting him till he informed him about the boy. So the boy was brought.\nThe king said to the boy: ''O boy! Has your (knowledge of) sorcery reached to the extent that\nyou cure born-biinds, lepers, leucodermic patients and do such and such?’ The boy replied:\n‘t do not cure anybody; it is only Allâh (Alone) Who does cure’. Then the king got hold of\nhim, and kept on tormenting him till he informed him about the monk. And the monk was\nbrought, and it was said to him: ‘Give up your religion (turn apostate)!’ The monk refused to\nturn apostate. Then the king ordered a saw (to be brought), and it was put in the middle of\nhis scalp and was sawn, till he fell, cut in two pieces. Then that courtier was brought, and it\nwas said to him: ‘Give up your religion (turn apostate)!’ The courtier refused to turn\napostate. So the saw was put in the middle of his scalp, and was sawn till he fell, cut in two\npieces. Then the boy was brought, and it was said to him: ‘Give up your religion (turn\napostate)!’ The boy refused to turn apostate. So the king ordered some of his courtiers to\ntake the boy to such and such a mountain saying, ‘Then ascend up the mountain with him\ntill you reach its top, and see if he turns apostate (from his religion, well and good);\notherwise throw him down from its top.’ They took him, ascended up the mountain, and the\nboy said: ‘O Allâh! Save me from them by anything You wish!’ So the mountain shook and\nall of them fell down, and the boy came walking to the king. The king asked him: ‘What did\nyour companions do?’ The boy said: ‘Allâh has saved me from them.’ The king then ordered \nsome of his courtiers to take the boy on board a boat into the middle of the sea, saying,\n‘Then if he turns apostate (from his religion, well and good), otherwise cast him into the\nsea.’ So they took him, and he said: ‘O Allâh! Save me from them by anything You wish.’ So\nthe boat capsized, and (all the accompanying courtiers) were drowned. The boy then came\nwalking to the king. The king said: ‘What did your companions do?’ The boy replied: ‘Allâh\nsaved me from them’, and he further said to the king: ‘You cannot kill me till you do what |\ncommand!’ The king said: ‘What is that (command of yours)?’ The boy said: ‘Gather all the\npeople in an upland place, and fasten me to the stem (of a tree); then take an arrow from\nmy quiver and fix it in the bow, and say: — In the Name of Allâh, the Lord of the boy, — and\nshoot (me). If you do that, you will kill me.’ So the king gathered the people in an upland place,\nand fastened the boy to the stem, took an arrow from his quiver, fixed it in the bow, and said:\n‘In the Name of Allâh, the Lord of the boy’, and shot the arrow. The arrow hit the temporal\nregion of the skull of the boy, and the boy put his hand over the temporal region of his skull at\nthe point where the arrow hit, and then died. The people proclaimed: ‘We have believed in the\nLord of the boy! We have believed in the Lord of the boy! We have believed in the Lord of the\nboy!’ The king came, and it was said to him: ‘That is the thing which you were afraid of. By\nAllâh! The thing which you were afraid of, has fallen upon you, the people have believed (in\nAllâh).’ So he ordered (deep) ditches to be dug at the entrances of the roads, and it was done,\nthen fire was kindled in those ditches, and the king ordered that whoever did not turn apostate\n(from his religion) be cast into the ditches, and it was done. Then there came a woman with\nher babe. She nearly retreated back from the ditch but the babe said (spoke): ‘O mother! Be\npatient, you are on the Truth,’ (So she threw herself in the ditch of the fire alongwith her child\nto be with the martyrs in Paradise).” (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 4, Hadith No. 7148).', '4.

(6193, '5', '105', '[1](V.105:5) The story of the army of the Elephants. This incident happened during the\nperiod of the birth-year of Prophet Muhammad صلي الله عليه وسلم, Abrahah Al-Ashram was the\ngovernor of Yemen on behalf of the king of Ethiopia (as Yemen was a part of the Ethiopian\nkingdom). He (Abrahah) thought to build a house (like the Ka‘bah at Makkah) in San‘a (the\ncapital of Yemen) and call the Arabs to perform the pilgrimage there in San‘a instead of the\nKa''bah (Al-Bait Al-Harâm) in Makkah, with the intention of diverting the trade and benefits\nfrom Makkah to Yemen. He presented his idea to the king of Ethiopia who agreed to his\nidea. So the house (church) was built and he named it A/-Quilais; there was no church of its\nlike at that time. Then a man from the Quraish tribe of Makkah came there and was\ninfuriated by it, so he relieved his nature (stools and urine) in it, soiled its walls and went\naway. When Abrahah Al-Ashram saw that, he could not control his anger and raised an\narmy to invade Makkah and demolish the Ka’bah. He had in that army thirteen elephants\nand amongst them was an elephant called Mahmûd which was the biggest of them. So that\narmy proceeded and none amongst the Arab tribes that faced them (fought against them)\nbut was killed and defeated, till it approached near Makkah. Then there took place\nnegotiations between Abrahah Al-Ashram and the chief of Makkah (Abdul Muttalib bin\nHashim, the grandfather of the Prophet plus 4c 4) 1.4), and it was concluded that Abrahah\nwould restore the camels of Abdul Muttalib which he had taken away, and then he (Abrahah\nAl-Ashram) would decide himself as regards the Ka‘bah. Abdul Muttalib ordered the men of\nMakkah to evacuate the city and go to the top of the mountains along with their wives and\nchildren in case some harm should come to them from the invading oppressors. Then that\narmy moved towards Makkah till they reached valley Muhassir. While the army was\nmarching towards Makkah, in the middle of the valley, suddenly it was overtaken by flocks\nof birds, flocks after flocks, air-raiding that army with small stones slightly bigger than a lentil\nseed. There never fell a stone on a Soldier except it dissolved his flesh and burst it into\npieces. So they perished with a total destruction. Abrahah Al-Ashram fled away while his\nflesh was bursting into pieces till he died on the way (back to Yemen). Such was the victory\nbestowed by Allah, (the All-Majestic, All-Powerful) to the people of Makkah and such was\nthe protection provided by Him for His House (Ka‘bah in Makkah).
